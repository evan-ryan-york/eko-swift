# Pre-Commit Check

Your task is to analyze the results of the following pre-commit checks for the Eko iOS project.

## 1. Swift Build Check

This command builds the Eko project to ensure there are no compilation errors.

**Build Output:**
!`xcodebuild -project Eko.xcodeproj -scheme Eko -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro Max' build 2>&1 | grep -E "error:|warning:|BUILD SUCCEEDED|BUILD FAILED" | head -20`

## 2. TypeScript Syntax Check

This command verifies TypeScript syntax in Supabase Edge Functions.

**Edge Functions Found:**
!`find supabase/functions -name "*.ts" -type f`

**Note:** Edge Functions use Deno and are validated on deployment via `npx supabase functions deploy`.

## Analysis

Review the build output above.

**If there are errors:**
- Summarize them clearly
- Identify the problematic files and line numbers
- Provide specific suggestions on how to fix them

**If both checks pass successfully:**
Respond with: "âœ… All pre-commit checks passed. Ready to commit."

Include:
- Number of Swift warnings (if any)
- Number of TypeScript files found
- Overall status
